      Annual color is a science and a practice of growing and cultivating flowers for decorative and aesthetic purposes.
      Annual color is a branh of horticulture that deals with the study of flowreing and ornamental plants, their
      propagation, cultivation and management. There is a wide range of annual color activities included in designs for
      your outdoor gardens. Landscape designers and landscape horticulturalists use annual color to create seasonal
      displays throughout the year. Come and explore ways to have a beautify and successful annual color display "For
      You!"

    <h3>Annual Color Installation</h3>
    <p>
      High quality annual color displays start with a design followed by proper preparation of each annual bed and
      finished with proper annual installation techniques.

    <h3>
      Plant choice!
    </h3>
    <p>With sound horticulture skills, design your annual color beds with appropriate plant types. Planting design is
      the foundation for all annual color beds. Use the right plants in the right place. Considering the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Environmental conditions
      2. Its microclimate
      3. Planting zone
      4. Sun or Shade
      5. Watering requirements
      6. Irrigation systems
      7. Patterns
      8. Plant height (e.g. relative to signage for example)
    </p>

    <h3>
      Bed Preparation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Time to get your hands dirty!
      1. Consider soil testing to achieve a pH balance between 6-7 (neutral). Add lime to raise the pH or sulfur to
      lower
      the pH.
      2. Remove all excess debris from the bed (mulch, plant material, roots, weeds, rocks etc.)
      3. The soil must be loose and organic with adequate drainage
      4. Add organic compost or amendments and incorporated into the bed to a depth of 10” - 12” (if the bed size is
      larger than desired, remove soil prior to adding amendments)
      5. Insure there is a 3”-4” trench along all hard surfaces (curbs, walks)
      6. According to the results of the pH test, add the appropriate fertilizer to achieve a balanced soil for desired
      annuals. Gernerally, use a 14-26-6 fertilizer, put out at a rate of 4 lb. per 1,000 sq. ft. This is equal to two
      16
      oz. cups full of fertilizer sprinkled lightly across a 1,000 sq. ft. bed.
      7. Rake freshly tilled bed to achieve a gentle slopped appearance in an effort to “display” your newly installed
      color. Flat beds are not attractive with poor drainage.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Setting out and planting
    </h3>
    <p>
      Annual installation starts with fertilizing the beds before setting out the plants.
      1. Hand watered thoroughly before planting.
      2. The plants should then be set out in straight, staggered rows and spaced correctly (pending plant type and
      desire). The first row should be set approximately 12” from the bottom of the bed. Pay close attention to the
      pre-determined planting design and follow it as closely as possible. (It is important to set out the bed before
      planting because it is easier to make adjustments before the plants are in the ground.)
      3. Once the entire bed is set out per planting design, planting may begin.
      4. Remove the annual from the pot and loosen the root ball by squeezing it lightly
      5. Install the plant with the top of the root ball level with the soil. (The only exception to this rule is when
      planting kale or cabbage, these varieties should be planted up to the top two or three whorls of leaves.)
      6. Avoid stepping into the bed while planting. If it is unavoidable, do not step on any plants and rake out any
      footprints. This important in order to insure that the mulch will sit evenly on the bed.
      7. Mulch is applied after planting in the form of small mini-bark nuggets or shredded hardwood mulch. The mulch
      acts as a weed barrier, helps retain soil moisture and gives the bed a decorative look. It is applied evenly over
      the bed and then dusted off of any plant material (DO NOT COVER PLANTS). Utilize the leftover mulch bags for
      clean-up(trash, pots, roots, rock etc).
      8. The beds should be watered by hand or the irrigation, if applicable. The irrigation must be set to run before
      leaving the property. The soil should be moist at finger’s depth and it should be checked in several locations.
      Water once every 3 days during the first 2 weeks following installation (1” of watering is the desired goal), then
      once a week should be sufficient pending weather.

    <h3>Annual Color Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
      The maintenance of annuals involves grooming, fertilizing, and inspecting for disease and pest problems. The task
      is time consuming, but necessary to maintain the quality and health of the plants.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Plant Inspection:
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. All annual bed plants should be inspected for insect infestation and disease weekly.
      2. Check the undersides of leaves and stems for insects and check plants for discoloration, premature shedding of
      leaves, loss of vigor and/or death of plant.
      3.Plan to treat accordingly if infestation of pest or disease is discovered or suspected.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Grooming
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. Remove dead and declining blooms
      2. Remove leaves that have turned yelow
      3. Prune or "pinch back" spent blooms and dead or dying stems back to the crown of the plant
      4. Remove all weeds that have emerged
      5. Touch up mini-bark nuggets and clean up and debris around the bed to complete grooming
    </p>

    <h3>
      Fertilization
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. pH is critical and important for all plants. Understanding your plant desired pH level is equally important.
      When plants are not performing, always take a soil sample and adjust your pH accordingly to achieve a 6.0-7.0
      range (in general for most annual color plants).
      2. Fertilizing your annual color is critical and important. Apply a time released, balanced fertilizer. For
      blooming annuals, use products similar to 7-22-8. For annuals with foliage interest, such as coleus, cabbage, kale
      and others that blooming isn’t encouraged, use a product similar to 19-6-12.
      3.The rate and types of fertilizer will change depending on the time of year and how established the annuals are.
