    <h2>Keith</h2>
    <p>Hey ya’ll. I am Keith Worsham, a native of Georgia and have spent my entire life in the picturesque landscapes of the Peach State. I was born and raised amidst the rolling hills and lush greenery of the pines and developed a deep passion for the outdoors from a young age. Today, I am a proud owner of a successful landscape design, build, install and maintenance firm servicing the metro Atlanta area. </p>

    <p>When I’m not crafting landscapes, I can be found enjoying time with my beautiful bride Pam (of 32 years Sept. 21st). I enjoy the serenity of the Georgia wilderness and traveling with my bride. We have 3 adult children, Ashleigh (and her husband Jake), Ryan (and his wife Juli) and Tyler (just graduated from UVU and starting his next adventure in life).</p>

    <p>One of my goals is learning something new and starting a new chapter in my professional career. I look forward to the opportunity of meeting new folks, being challenged and learning something new.</p>
